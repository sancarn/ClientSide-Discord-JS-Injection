It is often useful to be able to keep track of messages in discord, either for moderating or security purposes.

By running this script in the Discord application's console all message events (Messages added, removed, edited) will be logged to the console.

Future implementations might allow you to log the messages to a file.

P.S. This does not create a record of previously sent messages. This only tracks new messages on the server. To get a full list of old messages use https://dht.chylex.com/
